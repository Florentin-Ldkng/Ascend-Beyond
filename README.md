## 🧑‍💻 About  
Ascend Beyond is a minimalist procedural platformer designed to help me get back into programming.  
It focuses on movement physics, procedural map generation, and basic Steam integration.  

🎥 Devlogs documenting the journey are posted regularly on my YouTube channel:

## 🌱 Behind the Project

This project is a personal reset.

After not coding for a long time, I needed a small and focused way to get back into it.  
Ascend Beyond is meant to help me rebuild momentum and test things like the Steam SDK and the publishing process before starting a larger project later on.
